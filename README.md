# ANIA: An Inception-Attention Network for Predicting Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Antimicrobial Peptides

ANIA is a deep learning framework for predicting the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). It integrates Chaos Game Representation (CGR)-based sequence encoding with an Inception-Attention neural network to provide accurate MIC regression across multiple bacterial strains.

## Getting Started

This project provides a modular and command-line-driven pipeline via `main.py`, covering all stages from data collection to deep learning prediction.

### 1. Setup Conda Environments

```bash
# For deep learning (PyTorch + ANIA)
conda env create -f envs/AMP_DL_env.yml

# For CGR encoding (requires R and kaos)
conda env create -f envs/AMP_R_env.yml

# For classical ML and iFeature processing
conda env create -f envs/AMP_data_env.yml
```

### 2. Run the Pipeline via main.py

The pipeline consists of modular stages:

| Stage       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `collect`   | Collect raw AMP sequences and MIC values |
| `clean`     | Clean and aggregate the dataset |
| `group`     | Assign MIC groups (optional) |
| `split`     | Stratified splitting into training/testing |
| `ifeature`  | Extract iFeature features (AAC, PAAC, etc.) |
| `train_ml`  | Train ML models (e.g., SVM, RF, XGBoost) |
| `test_ml`   | Evaluate ML models |
| `cgr`       | Encode sequences using CGR |
| `train_ania`| Train ANIA deep learning model |
| `test_ania` | Test ANIA model and export predictions |

### Example Commands

```bash
# Step 1: Collect and Clean Data
python main.py --stage collect --log_path logs/collect.log
python main.py --stage clean --log_path logs/clean.log

# Step 2: Encode Sequences (CGR or iFeature)
python main.py --stage cgr --log_path logs/cgr.log
python main.py --stage ifeature --log_path logs/ifeature.log

# Step 3: Train and Test ML Models
python main.py --stage train_ml --log_path logs/train_ml.log --model_type ridge xgboost
python main.py --stage test_ml --log_path logs/test_ml.log --model_type ridge xgboost

# Step 4: Train and Test Deep Learning Model (ANIA)
python main.py --stage train_ania --strain "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" --log_path logs/train_ania.log
python main.py --stage test_ania --strain "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" --log_path logs/test_ania.log --model_input_path weights/ANIA_PA.pth --prediction_output_path results/ania_predict.csv
```
